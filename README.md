# LOCARIA Overview

LOCARIA is an open source platform for publishing location data either via a web based interface or API. LOCARIA is designed to be lightweight, easy to customise and extendable. If your use case falls into one of the following then LOCARIA will fit your purpose:-

- you have location data that needs categorizing and centralising
- you want a simple unified search/API over your location data
- you want to publish a map based website allowing users to search and interogate your data
- you want to add, update and delete data including contributions from third parties

LOCARIA will provide all of these features within a single ecosystem with no external dependencies. We have used LOCARIA to operate:-

- a public portal for local authorities allowing their customers to quickly find and view data linked to their household
- a heritage map displaying thousands of individuals linked to a famous battle and showing their linkages with towns, memorials and naval infrastructure
- a youth activities map, highlighting activities by category for young people and allowing them to find things to do i their locality
- a set of simple REST based APIs unifying 15 sets of location data for consumption within desktop GIS packages

LOCARIA is designed to be low maintenance and highly scalable. It will always be open source and available for free for those wishing to publish maps and location data. At present LOCARIA is focused upon deployment within the Amazon AWS web services infrastructure.
