# LOCARIA Overview

LOCARIA is an open source platform for publishing location data either via a web based interface or API. LOCARIA is designed to be lightweight, easy to customise and extendable. If your use case falls into one of the following then LOCARIA will fit your purpose:-

- you have location data that needs categorizing and centralising
- you want a simple unified search/API over your location data
- you want to publish a map based website allowing users to search and interogate your data
- you want to add, update and delete data including contributions from third parties

# Current refactoring

Please note we are refactoring the entire codebase at present to create a better separation of concerns. As a result this repository only contains legacy docs, tests and webclient code. Once finished we'll link required repositories.
